            <P>
                Pizza is an Italian food that was created in Italy (The Naples area). It is made with different toppings. Some of the most common toppings are cheese, sausages, pepperoni, vegetables, tomatoes, spices and herbs and basil. These toppings are added over a piece of bread covered with sauce.
                Pizza arrived the Middle East and spread very quickly and become favorite.

                I’m not fond of pizza, I have pizza only once a month and when there are no options, this time I had dinner at the Pizza restaurant. The menu contained exciting varieties in terms of appetizers, pizza and pasta with a detail of the ingredients of each dish.
                
                The appetizers were a chicken soup with delicious cream.
                
                The second dish was a mushroom dish with pashamel sauce (cream sauce) and the onion was excellent and the mushroom was fresh.
                
                The third dish was garlic bread.
                
                Then we ordered three types of pizza, medium size divided into four pieces.
                
                The pizza dough was light and soft and its ingredients were excellent in terms of quantity and taste.</P>

                    Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.

One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the italian flag.

                The best burgers offer a combination of tastes and textures – sweet, sour, salt – with a bit of crunch. The patty needs to be juicy, the bun soft but sturdy, and you want the meat/bun/accompaniment ratio to be even from first to last bite.The best burgers offer a combination of tastes and textures – sweet, sour, salt – with a bit of crunch.

                Chuck is the most commonly used cut of beef in burger blends. Marbled throughout and well-balanced in flavor with a decent lean-to-fat ratio, chuck steak is generally the primary cut used in burger blends and is supplemented with one or two other cuts of meat. Sirloin or Tri-Tip. </p>

                    There’s no denying that the hamburger occupies a unique place in the American mind. What other food conjures so many themes, stands for so many global forces as this iconic sandwich? Convenience, mass-production, globalization, capitalism, American exceptionalism—not to mention meat (lots of juicy, perfectly grilled meat).
                    The World is Your Burger: A Cultural History, a new book by David Michaels out now from Phaidon, conducts a deep dive into the development of the burger both as a food and as an idea. Michaels—a hospitality industry alum and owner of Bite Me Burger in Sydney—collects recipes, vintage photos and chef dispatches in his beautifully designed tome. One of our favorite sections is his meticulously researched burger timeline, which traces its journey from ground meat product to international idol.
